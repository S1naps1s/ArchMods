# ArchMods
These are my personal configuration files for my Arch install. I hope to add more as time goes on. 

# Getting Started
To get started create a shell script using the <a href="https://github.com/S1naps1s/ArchMods/blob/master/download-configs.sh">download-configs.sh</a> code. Run that in the terminal and the customizations should complete! I know they are crude, but I am new to a lot of this stuff.
